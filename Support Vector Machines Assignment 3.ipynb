    "1.Mean Absolute Error (MAE): This metric measures the average absolute difference between the predicted and actual values. \n",
    "It is useful when the dataset contains outliers that may affect the performance of other metrics. A lower MAE value\n",
    "indicates better performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Mean Squared Error (MSE): This metric measures the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values.\n",
    "It penalizes larger errors more heavily than smaller errors. A lower MSE value indicates better performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): This metric is similar to MSE but takes the square root of the MSE to make the units of\n",
    "the error metric the same as the target variable. It is useful when the target variable has a specific unit, such as \n",
    "dollars for house prices. A lower RMSE value indicates better performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.R-squared (R2): This metric measures the proportion of the variance in the target variable that is explained by the \n",
    "model. It ranges from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating better performance. R2 can be useful for comparing the \n",
    "performance of different models.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.R-squared adjusted: The R2_adj metric penalizes the inclusion of unnecessary predictor variables that do not contribute\n",

    "the model's performance.\n",

    "The R2_adj is calculated using the formula:\n",
